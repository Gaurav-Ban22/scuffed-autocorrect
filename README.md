**hey uh welcome to scuffed autocorrect simulator**

So what this does is simple. It autocorrects what you write but in a scuffed way.
~~I need a more casual dictionary.~~
This is also using difflib.SequenceMatcher, not any other algorithms or functions, meaning that it isn't suited perfectly for autocorrect and misguesses words a lot.
Hope you have fun, and remember to star all on my repos XD
